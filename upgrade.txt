========================

The Node Expressions add-on is provided in two versions - 'Lite' and 'Full' :

The 'Lite' version is sufficient for the quick creation of very simple expressions
(such as 'a+b+c' or 'mod(x, 1/Scale)*Scale') but the 'Full' version provides additional
functionality makes working with much more complicated expressions a breeze.

To obtain the 'full' version, purchase through Blender Market at :
    
    https://blendermarket.com/products/node-expressions


Alternatively, send GBP 4.00 (or equivalent value in another currency) via paypal to :

    https://www.paypal.me/BaldingWizard
    
 and I'll email the latest version (for future updates, simply send me an email from the
 same address as your paypal payment and I'll send the the latest update).
 
 
To install the upgrade, simply uninstall (or disable) the 'lite' version and use the 
'install from zip' option within Blender to install the 'full' version from the 'zip' file.
